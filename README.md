# caddy-shack
## README.md
__What's in the name?__ This project is named for the way the other software flys above the clouds, and a comedic take on how it would be the solution for a personal computer as opposite to the other software's soaring nature, as to win that green jacket, gold jacket, or whatever color it may be (if someone really cares what color the jacket you would win), you would need a caddy or assistant to guide you to the solution in some way. Please, I am building this for personal and non business use only. Please standby and watch this repository for updates soon.

__Day 1 -- 10/13/2024:__ This is for all those users out there that have a personal computer that has been infected with your work IT's monitorware software and remote ssh tunnels somehow, because you work at home, and have used the same private network with your work computer as your personal computer over the past month or two;
this will be an ongoing project and is jump started from my work over the past weeks, but this repository will be an ongoing effort as my time permits.

__Day 2 -- 10/14/2024:__ Don't fret. A solution is on the way. If you are developing alongside with me, my goal is to allow those seriously interested in a solution who have existing software products that are positioned to implement my solution. My solution includes a little bit of _ws2tcpip_ and a lot of _iphlpapi_. Stay tuned, please.
